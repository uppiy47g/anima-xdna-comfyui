# Anima XDNA 2 ComfyUI MODEL wrapper

This custom-node package replaces only the 28 `transformer_blocks` in ComfyUI's
native Anima Base v1.0, Turbo V1.1, or validated WAI Nova Anima Turbo LoRA
Ver V1.0 diffusion model with the resident Triton-XDNA/XRT runtime. It does
**not** use ONNX or Vitis AI EP.

For an isolated Windows setup, sanitized launcher/model-path templates, the
full verification ladder, image evidence, and machine-readable measurements,
see the [public reproducibility report](../docs/anima-xdna-reproducibility.md).

ComfyUI still executes:

- Qwen 3 0.6B tokenization and the Anima LLM adapter
- latent patch embedding, timestep embedding, and RoPE setup
- LayerNorm/AdaLN, RMSNorm, softmax, GELU, gates, and residual operations
- final projection/unpatchify, sampler orchestration, and Qwen Image VAE

XDNA 2 executes 532 Linear/QK/AV GEMM dispatches in the default 28-block
chain. The self/cross Q/K/V projection groups each run as one `NPUChain`
dispatch; the optional `qkv_chaining=false` input restores the prior
644-dispatch path for comparison. Weights, kernel objects, contexts, and BOs
remain resident between denoising steps. The wrapper never silently falls
back to CPU.

## Supported contract

- ComfyUI API validated at commit
  `170594057a22673349ddf0a3d88624b7fa5865bb`
- native Base v1.0, Turbo V1.1, WAI Nova Anima Turbo LoRA Ver V1.0, or
  Radiance Turbo Anima v2.0 transformer loaded by
  **Load Anima (BF16)** (explicit ComfyUI `dtype=torch.bfloat16`)
- matching read-only XDNA source: validated Diffusers/native Base for Base,
  or the same native Turbo checkpoint for Turbo
- batch 1, latent `[1,16,1,64,64]`, 512x512 output
- adapted Qwen context `[1,512,1024]`
- BF16 model weights and block activations, FP32 sampler latent

Preview/Aesthetic checkpoints, LoRA patches, LLLite, INT8, other
batch/resolution/context sizes, and training are rejected. The normal ComfyUI
MODEL is cloned; it is not modified. Before XRT opens, the wrapper computes a
canonical full digest over all 560 block tensors. Base/Turbo or other
MODEL/source mismatches are rejected before BO population or dispatch.
For an F16 or F32 source, matching is performed after the same explicit BF16
normalization used by the XDNA packed cache. Raw source hashes and dtypes still
remain part of the cache identity.

## Installation

Place or clone this repository below `ComfyUI\custom_nodes`, then install it in
the same Python environment that starts ComfyUI:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/uppiy47g/anima-xdna-comfyui.git `
  ComfyUI\custom_nodes\anima-xdna-comfyui
cd ComfyUI\custom_nodes\anima-xdna-comfyui
python -m pip install -e .
```

That environment also needs the Windows XRT SDK/`pyxrt`, Triton-XDNA and its
matching MLIR wheels. Set `XRT_DEV_DIR` to the XRT SDK directory before
starting ComfyUI. The packed cache defaults to
`%USERPROFILE%\.cache\anima-xdna\weights`.

## Nodes

1. Load the native Anima MODEL with **Load Anima (BF16)**. Its selector
   includes both `diffusion_models:` transformer files and `checkpoints:`
   full checkpoints; unqualified legacy workflow values still resolve as
   `diffusion_models`.
   The normal `UNETLoader` does not expose BF16; on the validated CPU setup
   its default Anima policy chooses FP32. The custom loader passes BF16 through
   ComfyUI's supported `load_diffusion_model` options and refuses the result
   if any transformer-block Parameter expanded to another dtype.
2. Connect it to **Load/Attach Anima XDNA Model**.
3. Set `checkpoint` to the matching source. For Base, use the validated Base
   Diffusers transformer or equivalent native Base checkpoint. For Turbo,
   select the exact same native Turbo V1.1 checkpoint as `UNETLoader`. The file
   remains read-only and is the XDNA cache source of truth.
   If its block weights are F16 or F32, the first attach creates a verified
   BF16 packed cache without modifying the checkpoint. The ComfyUI log and
   runtime status explain this conversion; later attaches report verified
   cache reuse.
4. Connect the returned MODEL to the normal sampler.
5. Use **Anima XDNA Runtime Status** to inspect cache state, first/warm timing,
   dispatches, transfers, BO population, allocations, and resident reuse.
6. Use **Unload Anima XDNA Runtime** before switching checkpoints when an
   immediate release is required. Garbage collection also releases the
   attachment.

   The validated WAI Nova file is a full ComfyUI checkpoint containing Anima,
   Qwen, and VAE tensors, not a standalone LoRA delta. The BF16 loader extracts
   its `model.diffusion_model.*` Anima component; use the normal Qwen and VAE
   workflow nodes for the remaining components. The XDNA source selector must
   reference the same full checkpoint so the 560-tensor canonical fingerprint
   check remains exact.

`qkv_chaining` defaults to enabled. It only fuses the three Q/K/V projection
launches within each attention module; LayerNorm/AdaLN, RMSNorm, RoPE,
scale/mask/softmax, GELU, gates, and residual operations remain on CPU.

`rebuild_cache` explicitly recreates the packed cache when the attach node
executes. ComfyUI caches the node result for unchanged inputs, so changing this
input from `false` to `true` forces one rebuild; repeated prompts with the same
`true` value reuse that attached result. Toggle it back before requesting a
later rebuild. Checkpoint file identity and attach options are part of the
cache key, while the MODEL dependency is tracked by ComfyUI. `cache_dir` may
point to another user-writable ASCII path. It must not point into the model
folder.

The attach status reports block Parameter logical/unique-storage bytes and
dtype counts after source identity matches. It warns when CPU block Parameters
are FP32. XRT BO population is reported separately. ModelPatcher clones share
the underlying module, so attach never deletes or replaces block Parameters;
LoRA/patch/state-dict behavior has no safe lazy-restore contract today.
Fresh-process measurements on the validated host found stock FP32 loading
used about 7.12 GB more process PrivateUsage than BF16 loading for either
checkpoint (46.5%); see the evidence for working-set and peak counters. A
separate BF16-plus-XRT fixture run verified matching Base/Turbo fingerprints
and resident BO reuse. The exact Turbo 8-step Euler/simple/CFG-1/seed-424242
BF16+XDNA workflow reproduced the previous validated XDNA image pixelwise;
the latent differs from the stock-FP32 CPU reference by 25.55% normalized
RMS. This supports decoded-image parity with the prior XDNA path, not latent
equivalence to CPU or a speedup claim.

## Verified result

On Ryzen AI 9 365 / Strix XDNA 2 (`npu2`), XRT 2.21.75 and Triton-XDNA
3.6.0.2026093004:

- native ComfyUI MODEL registration and loading succeeded
- one complete synthetic DiT comparison: normalized RMS 0.01528
- real Qwen prompt, Euler, two steps: latent normalized RMS 0.01819
- isolated cold wrapper call: 26.73 s, including 3,963,617,280 bytes of
  process-local weight BO population
- historical pre-Q/K/V second resident wrapper call: 7.73 s total / 7.57 s
  chain, 644 dispatches, 644 resident hits, zero weight population bytes and
  no recompile
- resident profiles count output bytes synchronized from XRT BOs to host
  visibility in `last_d2h_host_visible_bytes`; these are not additional
  staging-buffer allocations
- real Qwen prompt, CFG 3.5, one denoising step: normalized RMS 0.04068
  (the two CFG branches execute sequentially on the single-tenant NPU)
- decoded 512x512 images: PSNR 36.33 dB, SSIM 0.8458
- current 28-block Q/K/V-chained path: 532 dispatches and 8,085,045,248 H2D
  bytes per denoising step, versus 644 dispatches and 8,349,286,400 H2D bytes
  with chaining disabled; device-to-host-visible output bytes are unchanged

Turbo V1.1 was additionally validated from its native 685-tensor BF16
checkpoint. A real Qwen/Euler/CFG 1 one-step sampler latent passed at
normalized RMS `0.02650`; an 8-step 512x512 run produced PSNR `19.855 dB`,
SSIM `0.82480`, and 8-bit MAE `10.884` against the CPU reference. The local
8-step setting is validated here, but is not claimed as an official V1.1
recommendation. Turbo's synthetic chain has a transient block-13 normalized
RMS peak of `0.08455` and final `0.01004`; use the documented separate
10% intermediate / 2% final gate rather than Base's uniform 5% gate.
On 2026-10-06, a same-server warm 8-step Euler/simple/CFG 1/seed 424242
comparison measured 147.56 s with `qkv_chaining=false` and 139.18 s with it
enabled. The final 512x512 RGB images were pixel-identical. A real Base
preprocessing fixture exposed 7.828% transient CPU-oracle NRMS at block 14
against the strict 5% Base gate; the chained and previous XDNA paths were
bitwise equal at every block, with 0.8407% final NRMS. This is recorded as a
Base oracle limitation, not a passing Base chain gate.

The first call additionally verifies the 3.96 GB packed cache and populates
process-local XRT BOs, so cold and warm timings must not be compared as the
same phase.

Measured BF16 loader details, Windows process-memory methodology, the
stock-FP32/BF16 memory pair, and the end-to-end image/latent comparison are
recorded in the [reproducibility report](../docs/anima-xdna-reproducibility.md).

If an applied LoRA/ModelPatcher patch, unsupported shape, incompatible
ComfyUI API, cache corruption, XRT failure, or numerical/runtime error is
encountered, execution raises an actionable error instead of calling the
original CPU block loop.
