# Anima resident transformer chain on AMD XDNA 2

This isolated proof of concept executes either one Anima Linear or the complete
Anima/Cosmos transformer chain (one block, a range, or all 28 blocks) directly
from its original safetensors on XDNA 2 through Triton-XDNA and XRT. It does
**not** use ONNX, Vitis AI EP, or a converted model format, and it does not
modify ComfyUI or model files.

## Supported model and exact block

The block adapter follows the local Diffusers `CosmosTransformer3DModel`
implementation used by Anima Base v1.0 (`diffusers 0.39.0.dev0`):

1. AdaLN-Zero: SiLU, 2048->256->6144, affine-free LayerNorm (`eps=1e-6`),
   shift/scale/gate, and the model-level `temb`.
2. Self-attention: 2048-wide Q/K/V, 16 heads of 128, learned Q/K RMSNorm
   (`eps=1e-6`), Cosmos image RoPE, non-causal attention, and output projection.
3. Cross-attention: 2048-wide Q, 1024-wide text K/V, 16x128 heads, Q/K
   RMSNorm, optional `[B,1,1,S]` mask, and output projection.
4. MLP: exact GELU (`approximate="none"`) with 2048->8192->2048 projections.
5. A gated residual follows each attention and MLP stage.

The loader validates all 20 block tensors and materializes only requested
tensors through `safetensors.safe_open`. The original checkpoint remains the
read-only source of truth. Native Triton cache entries contain compiled
kernels; the separate packed-weight cache described below is a verified,
regenerable local derivative and is never a replacement model.

Positive compatibility covers full BF16 **Anima Base v1.0** checkpoints in
Diffusers `transformer_blocks.*` or native `net.*` form and the validated full
native **Turbo V1.1** checkpoint in `model.diffusion_model.*` form. The loader
canonicalizes all 560 block tensors, while the cache manifest retains every
exact source key. LoRA adapters and quantized checkpoints remain unsupported.

## NPU, attention fusion, and residency

Every block Linear and every QK-transpose/attention-value GEMM runs on XDNA 2.
The current optimized path uses **19 XRT dispatches per block**:

- 15 standalone Linear dispatches (the 16 logical model Linear operations,
  with the 8192-wide MLP output reduction split into four FP32 partials,
  minus the six Q/K/V projections grouped below);
- two Q/K/V dispatches, each an `NPUChain` containing three BF16 Linear
  launches for one attention module;
- four attention dispatches: self QK, self AV, cross QK, and cross AV.

Each attention dispatch uses Triton-XDNA's official `NPUChain` multi-launch API
to stitch the 16 correct head-specific Triton kernels into one ELF/XRT run.
Q/K/V chaining removes four more XRT launches per block by sharing the self
attention input and staging cross query/context once each. Set the ComfyUI
`qkv_chaining` input to `false` to run the 23-dispatch comparison path. A
single 3D Triton grid was tested and rejected because the
installed AIE2P lowering corrupted heads at realistic multi-tile shapes;
folding heads into the program M dimension was also rejected by AIR tile-size
inference. Neither unsafe path is used by the package.

The resident session owns the XRT device, ELF objects, hardware contexts,
kernels, and mapped `ext.bo` buffers. Static weight BOs are populated once and
reused across blocks/runs; dynamic input and output BOs are reused by shape.
The Q/K/V chains own three `shared.empty` output buffers per signature and
bind them through Triton-XDNA's public `bound_buffers` interface; these
session-lifetime buffers are closed on normal exit or error. Outputs are
copied to BF16 CPU tensors because subsequent normalization/attention stages
are still host-side. This reuses output allocation, not block-to-block
activation values, and does not eliminate output synchronization. The profiler
counts device-to-host-visible bytes; no separate D2H staging tensor is
implied. Cache synchronization time is reported separately for ordinary
Linear dispatches; the head-chain API combines launch and output
synchronization time. After population, checkpoint tensors are replaced by
shape/dtype metadata (except the small Q/K RMSNorm vectors), avoiding a second
approximately 4 GB host copy while the resident BOs are live. The safetensors
checkpoint always remains the source of truth.

SiLU, LayerNorm/AdaLN modulation, Q/K RMSNorm, RoPE, scale/mask/softmax, exact
GELU, tensor reshapes, gates, and residual additions remain explicit PyTorch
CPU operations over shared/mapped memory. These operations and their timing
are reported; there is no silent CPU fallback. Parameterized GEMMs account for
137,451,536,384 logical FLOPs per block and are all on the NPU.

The supported 512x512 path is batch 1, 1024 image tokens, hidden size 2048,
512 context tokens, and context width 1024. The deterministic default input is
synthetic. The current Base and Turbo hardware chain fixtures were captured
read-only before block 0 during standalone ComfyUI prompt generation with the
Qwen encoder, model patch/time embeddings, and Cosmos RoPE; fixture files are
local-only and are not distributed.

## Windows prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 x64 and AMD XDNA 2/AIE2P (`npu2`) with a current AMD NPU
  driver.
- Python 3.13 is recommended because the official Windows `pyxrt.pyd` uses that
  ABI.
- Visual Studio 2022 Desktop development with C++, CMake, and Ninja.
- An official [Xilinx/XRT release](https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT/releases)
  Windows SDK. Extract the inner `xrt` directory to a user-writable location,
  set `XRT_DEV_DIR`, and copy only its ABI-matching `pyxrt.pyd` into the
  dedicated virtual environment.
- Official AMD Triton-XDNA, MLIR-AIR, MLIR-AIE, LLVM-AIE, and PyTorch CPU
  wheels.

Validated versions are Python 3.13.9, Triton-XDNA
`3.6.0.2026093004+75679dc`, and XRT 2.21.75. The XRT
`xrt_windows_sdk.zip` SHA-256 is
`ccc244c2c423588972ade76142cdc01049477aaa39a35be97e782b97eb7c5295`.
Do not set `XILINX_XRT` on Windows; use `XRT_DEV_DIR`.

MLIR-AIE uses relative intermediates and upstream generated transforms contain
UTF-8 punctuation. The runtime stages compilation under the ASCII-only
`%USERPROFILE%\.cache\anima-xdna` path so Japanese repository paths work
without a global encoding change.

`anima-xdna-probe` must report `target: npu2` and `runtime: xrt`.
The block and chain CLIs report exact shape/range, NPU/host operation timing,
dispatches, H2D/D2H staging bytes, allocations/resident hits, host-copy,
cache-sync and kernel/wait time, logical NPU FLOPs, cold/populate/cached timing,
and blockwise numerical errors.

On the validated Ryzen AI 9 365 / NPU Strix system, Anima Base block 0 at
1024/512 captured inputs produced:

| Metric | Legacy per-head path | Resident stitched path |
|---|---:|---:|
| XRT dispatches/block | 83 | 23 |
| H2D staging/block | 612,237,312 B | 156,631,040 B |
| Device-to-host-visible output/block | 314,048,512 B | 314,048,512 B |
| cached wall/block | about 2.086 s | 0.236-0.362 s |

The historical resident D2H value was recorded as `0 B` because no separate
staging tensor was used; it did not mean the host could read output without an
XRT BO synchronization. The corrected counter reports 314,048,512 output
bytes per block while the number of separate D2H staging-buffer copies remains
zero. Current `anima-xdna-chain --profile` output counts these bytes as
`d2h_staging_bytes` for compatibility with the JSON profile field name.

On 2026-10-06, one warm resident block-0 run using deterministic synthetic
inputs measured Base at 334.47 ms wall (60.71 ms host stages, 269.62 ms NPU
stages) and Turbo at 342.37 ms (68.71 ms host, 268.66 ms NPU). Both used 23
dispatches, 156,631,040 H2D bytes, and 314,048,512 synchronized output bytes;
normalized RMS against each CPU block oracle was 0.0025100 (Base) and
0.0025191 (Turbo). These are single-block observations, not captured-chain or
end-to-end benchmarks. A trial that fused QK attention scaling into the
stitched Triton kernel was reverted: the validated AIR pipeline failed
compilation with `iterator_interchange` length 4 for a 2-loop operation. The
scale and softmax therefore remain on CPU, and this phase claims no generation
speedup.

One representative steady optimized block measured 252.4 ms wall, including
111.2 ms XRT kernel/wait, 35.7 ms explicit host operations, 2.5 ms mapped-BO
host copies, and 3.3 ms cache synchronization. The legacy synthetic benchmark
was 0.662 s and its CPU oracle was 0.717 s. The optimized path is both faster
than that CPU result and materially reduces dispatch and staging.

The first build of all four stitched 16-head artifacts took approximately
862 s on this toolchain; the native Triton cache reuses those shape-specific
artifacts for every block and later process. This compile cost is never
reported as steady execution.

The earlier pre-Q/K/V 23-dispatch full-chain profile measured:

- 644 dispatches (`23 x 28`);
- cached steady wall times of 7.02, 7.03, and 7.15 s;
- approximately 0.25 s median per block;
- 23.19 s for the CPU oracle (about 3.3x slower);
- 4,385,669,120 B H2D and 8,793,358,336 B of device-to-host-visible output;
- about 3.22 s total XRT kernel/wait, 73-75 ms host copy, and 86-89 ms cache
  synchronization;
- final normalized RMS error `0.007466678`;
- worst normalized RMS error `0.041646643` at block 13;
- final max/mean absolute error 1664 / 7.2158.

Absolute errors become large at sparse, very high-magnitude activations in the
deep chain. That earlier fixture passed its fixed 5% per-block gate; it is not
the current real ComfyUI Base fixture below. This does not replace strict
single-block coverage: the deterministic block integration still compares
elementwise with `rtol=0.02`, `atol=0.003`. The CPU adapter was also checked
against the installed Diffusers 0.39.0 authoritative 28-block chain and ended
at about 0.7% normalized RMS difference.

Turbo's separate 10% intermediate / 2% final chain gate is defined for the
captured real preprocessing fixture used by the ComfyUI validation. The
default synthetic seed-0 input is deliberately outside that claim and was
rejected at 9.61% final normalized RMS. Always pass a real captured fixture
when reproducing the Turbo chain gate; the real one-step ComfyUI sampler test
is the end-to-end oracle.

## Q/K/V chaining measurements

On 2026-10-06, the captured 1024-image-token / 512-context Base and Turbo
fixtures measured the 23-dispatch path against Q/K/V chaining on the same
resident runtime:

| Metric | Separate projections | Q/K/V chained |
|---|---:|---:|
| XRT dispatches/block | 23 | 19 |
| 28-block XRT dispatches | 644 | 532 |
| H2D bytes/block | 298,188,800 | 288,751,616 |
| H2D bytes/28-block chain (one denoising step) | 8,349,286,400 | 8,085,045,248 |
| D2H-visible bytes/block | 314,048,512 | 314,048,512 |
| D2H-visible bytes/28-block chain | 8,793,358,336 | 8,793,358,336 |
| Reported BO allocation events/28-block chain | 542 | 630 |

The 9,437,184-byte H2D reduction per block is one shared self-attention input
and one shared cross-attention context input; the Q/K/V weights and all
host-visible outputs are unchanged. The allocation-event counter includes
per-key weight BO population; three output BOs per chain signature are reused
across block keys after initial creation. A captured-fixture validation pair
measured Base at 18.397 s -> 17.313 s and Turbo at 17.418 s -> 17.843 s.
These are noisy chain-wall samples, not a stable speed claim or sampler
timing.

Every block output across the 28-block Base and Turbo fixtures was bitwise
equal between the separate-projection and chained XDNA paths. Turbo's CPU
oracle comparison passed its declared 10% intermediate / 2% final gate:
0.0599236 worst at block 12 and 0.0117299 final. The real Base fixture's
optimized and legacy XDNA outputs also match bitwise, but both show 0.0782801
worst transient normalized RMS at block 14 against the strict 5% Base
CPU-oracle gate; the final error is 0.00840710. This is reported as an
existing Base numerical limitation, not treated as a Base gate pass or hidden
by Turbo's wider intermediate threshold.

The standalone ComfyUI-XDNA 8-step Euler/simple/CFG 1, seed 424242, 512x512
Turbo workflow was repeated with only `qkv_chaining` changed. The paired warm
execution measured 147.56 s disabled and 139.18 s enabled (5.68% lower);
the RGB output pixels were identical (8-bit MAE 0). The first workflow after
server startup was not used for the paired timing because cold/warm cache
effects were visible. This remains CPU-hybrid: Qwen, all listed normalization,
RoPE, softmax, GELU, residual/gate operations, sampler, final projection, and
VAE remain on CPU. No NPU-only claim is made.

Failures use distinct categories and exit codes: dependency unavailable (2),
NPU unavailable (3), unsupported shape/config/dtype (4), compilation failure
(5), execution failure (6), and numerical mismatch (7).

## Packed-weight cache

The default cache is
`%USERPROFILE%\.cache\anima-xdna\weights\<cache-key>`. It stores the exact BF16
K-by-N tensors consumed by the AIE2P Linear kernels after transpose, K-chunking,
zero-padding, and layout preparation, plus the four small Q/K RMSNorm vectors
per block. It does not copy or bundle the source safetensors and is not a
portable or distributable model format. The cache may be deleted and rebuilt
at any time; model privacy and license obligations still apply to the original
checkpoint.

The human-readable `manifest.json` records:

- a full SHA-256 content fingerprint of every used tensor byte range, every
  safetensors header, and a shard index when present;
- model family, complete architecture, block range, and exact weight-key map;
- source/packed dtype and shape, offsets, padding, K-chunking, and layout ABI;
- `base_model_fingerprint`, future `adapter_fingerprints`, `merge_strength`,
  `quantization_scheme`, and `layout_version` namespace fields;
- Triton-XDNA, MLIR-AIE/AIR, LLVM-AIE, XRT SDK, `npu2`, and PoC cache ABI;
- one payload SHA-256 and a SHA-256 for every packed tensor record.

A warm hit verifies Windows file identity/change-time/size, all headers, and
three distributed byte ranges in every used source tensor. The full content
hash established at build remains in the cache key. It concurrently verifies
the complete 3.96 GB payload SHA-256 before mmap. Any guard, header, range,
manifest, size, or digest mismatch is a miss or explicit integrity failure;
corrupt entries are never loaded silently. Builds use an exclusive
per-key lock, write into a unique temporary directory, fsync the payload, and
atomically rename the completed directory. Failed builds clean only their own
temporary directory.

`anima-xdna-chain` enables the cache by default. Use `--no-weight-cache`,
`--cache-dir PATH`, or `--rebuild-cache` to disable, relocate, or explicitly
regenerate it. `anima-xdna-block` has the same switches.
`anima-xdna-linear --weight-cache` reuses the full entry for exact
`transformer_blocks.N.*` Linear keys. Management commands are:

```powershell
anima-xdna-cache inspect CHECKPOINT
anima-xdna-cache verify CHECKPOINT
anima-xdna-cache rebuild CHECKPOINT
anima-xdna-cache list
anima-xdna-cache prune CHECKPOINT
anima-xdna-cache prune --entry-key <64-hex-cache-key>
```

`prune` resolves and verifies one exact manifest entry; it never recursively
deletes a wildcard or the cache root. Payload pages are memory-mapped and
copied into process-local XRT BOs. BO handles/device pointers are never
persisted. CLI timings keep fingerprint/guard validation, packing, mmap,
payload verification, and BO population separate.

For Anima Base v1.0 blocks 0-27 the final entry contains 644 unique records:
532 Linear K-chunks and 112 RMSNorm tensors. It occupies 3,963,645,952 bytes
for 3,875,565,568 logical source bytes; zero padding adds 88,080,384 bytes
(2.27%). Measurements on the validated system were:

| Phase | Time |
|---|---:|
| cache disabled, cold prepare | 10.089 s |
| cache disabled, OS-warm prepare | 5.355-5.538 s |
| clean cold fingerprint | 5.528-5.758 s |
| clean cold pack/write | 13.409-13.671 s |
| clean cold total | 19.834-19.865 s |
| new-process warm source validation | 34-42 ms |
| new-process warm payload verification | 4.316-4.529 s |
| new-process warm total | 4.330-4.546 s |

The full first-run 28-block path, including verification, BO population,
kernel execution, and host stages, fell from 23.822 s without the cache to
21.843 s with a verified warm hit. The first resident upload copied
3,963,617,280 packed Linear bytes into weight BOs and measured 516.8 ms without
the cache versus 631.0 ms from mmap-backed payload pages in the compared runs;
the cache removes source transpose/padding, not BO upload. Once resident, both
paths reuse the same BOs and have identical transfer behavior. Cached and
uncached 28-block XDNA outputs were bitwise equal, and the existing Diffusers/
CPU normalized-RMS gate continued to pass. Times vary with OS file-cache state;
cold build time is intentionally not presented as warm-hit performance.

## Tests and limitations

CPU tests cover exact key/config discovery, lazy block loading, shape rejection,
layout/padding, deterministic inputs, RoPE, attention masks, the complete CPU
block residual path, block-index mapping, and CPU range execution. Real-NPU
tests cover Linear, stitched-versus-legacy block attention, the optimized
19-dispatch block, resident reuse, and the complete 28-block numerical chain
with old/new Q/K/V output parity:

```powershell
$env:ANIMA_XDNA_CHECKPOINT = "<DIFFUSERS_TRANSFORMER_SAFETENSORS>"
$env:ANIMA_XDNA_CHAIN_FIXTURE = "<CAPTURED_BLOCK_INPUT_PT>"
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Without those variables or the toolchain, hardware tests skip with the precise
missing boundary.

The low-level CLIs remain independently useful, while the current
[`comfyui_xdna_nodes`](../comfyui_xdna_nodes/README.md) package now integrates
the resident chain into ComfyUI. Host normalization, softmax, GELU, gates, and
residuals still expose mapped buffers to PyTorch and require cache
synchronization; the reported H2D figure is bytes copied into mapped BO pages
on a unified-memory APU, not necessarily physical DRAM traffic. LoRA and INT8
remain intentionally unsupported.
